## Features

1. Timer will start just after rendering of the problem page.

2. Helps a lot in interview preparations.
3. Keeps you active during problem solving sessions. 
4. Sometimes, we give unnecessarily more time to a question without realising. You can choose your time limit (mine is 20 - 40 mins depend on the toughness of question). Simply see the editorial/approach after that time limit.
